# String Surgery

Small Java library for making string computations simpler and more efficient.

## Features

Not really. It currently has string slicing and maybe one day it will also have
actually cool stuff with as efficient utilities for constructing and iterating strings.

The only dependencies of the project are JDK 1.5+ and [primitivo](https://github.com/halleknast/primitivo).
